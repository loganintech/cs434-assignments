Description:
    Train a multi-nomial Naive Bayes classifier with Laplace smooth with Î± = 1 on the training
    set. This involves learning P(y = 1), P(y = 0), P(wi|y = 1) for i = 1, ..., |V | and P(wi|y = 0) for
    i = 1, ..., |V | from the training data (the first 30k reviews and their associated labels).

Learn p(y=1):
Given a set of N training reviews, MLE of the parameters are:
    P(y=1) = N1/N, where N1 is the number of positive reviews.
